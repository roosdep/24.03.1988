            IT IS a giant step that Chinese opera is taking at the Young
            People's Theatre this year. In an effort to win young hearts and
            minds to this traditional art form, the Chinese Theatre Circle is
            using stilt-walkers in one of the excerpts it is presenting at the
            Victoria Theatre next Thursday. It is the first time that Chinese
            opera is offered as an item in the Young People's Theatre. Together
            with a host of other captivating stunts, the amateur group is
            introducing the rare skill of stilt-walking which has not been
            fea- tured in local opera performances before. Five stilt-walkers,
            all members of the Circle, will be showing off their skills in the
            opera excerpt, Princess Iron Fan And The Monkey God - an
            action-filled episode from the Chinese classic, Journey classic, Jo
            To The West. In that scene, 10 little monkeys disciples of the
            Monkey God- engage themselves in play at Water Curtain Cave.
            Five are exceptionally tall they are the stilt-walkers who will
            walk and roll gracefully on stilts measuring about 1.2-m high. The
            punchy kick-off to the 40-minute opera performance - one of three
            opera excerpts presented - may last a short three minutes, but
            getting the act right took nearly four months of hard training. Mr
            Choy Yien Chow, the group's artistic director and martial arts
            instructor, said: "Stilt-walking is a difficult stunt, the actors
            kept falling and suffering bruises during practice sessions." The
            art of walking tall dates back to 2000 BC, in the reign of Emperor
            Shun. That period of Chinese history was known as The Golden Age
            when Emperor Shun's subjects enjoyed good harvests and a happy But the good life
            did not last long. The Yellow River burst its banks and rice crops
            were destroyed. It was said that the whole of China was flooded.
            Emperor Shun, known for his wisdom, came up with an idea to help his
            people wade through the high waters. It was said that he invented
            stilt-walking by using two long bamboo po Loops were connected to
            the bamboo poles to keep the feet above ground. This ingenious idea
            then caught on among his subjects. In later years, children began
            to take a keen interest in this method of managing in floods and
            stilt-walking gradually developed into a sport. The one who could
            beat the others to the top of the hill became the village marathon
            walk champion. The five stilt-walkers are Xu Xiaotian (13), Huang
            Qiuwen (13), Lin Jiafu (18), Chen Mingshun (19) and Chen Yongqiang
            (18). They are coached by Huang Shuijun, 25, a local expert in
            stilt-walking. Huang plays the Monkey God but will not be on stilts.
            Mr Choy said that two types of stilt-walking are employed in Chinese
            operas. One uses tall stilts, as high as 1.8 m. This is used mainly
            by men in martial arts sequences. The other type makes use of hard
            and soft stilts. These are used by women in the portrayal of the
            comic or caidan role. The hard stilts measure about 15 cm high and
            the soft stilts, 7.5 cm high. The rest of the episode will showcase
            Monkey God and his little monkeys in an exciting battle with
            Princess Iron Fan. The other two opera are Stealing The Magic Herb (from Madam White Snake) and Duel At The Crossroads. These promise to be as thrilling as Princess Iron Fan And The
            Monkey God. Duel At The Crossroads, in particular, is a feast of
            magnificent stunts presented by Lu Liangwei, a martial arts
            competition winner here. Set in the period of Song dynasty, Duel
            centres on a warrior, Ren Tanghui, who is assigned to protect
            his colleague, Jiao Zhan, who has been arrested on false charges. A
            duel the highlight of the opera ensues when Ren (played by Zhang
            Xiaohui) and inn helper Liu Lihua (played by Lu Liangwei) meet in
            the dark, each suspecting the other of trying to harm Jiao.
            Fifteen-year-old Liangwei won fourth prize in the Short Weapon
            (Youth) Section of a national pugilistic contest last year. In Duel,
            he will display such breathtaking stunts as rolling down from a
            table and balancing himself on the table legs while fighting with
            his opponent. Xu Xiaotian (one of the stilt-walkers) and Lan
            Weihua (one of the monkeys) also won prizes in the same contest
            Xiaotian won fourth prize in the Long Weapon Section and Weihua,
            third prize in the Boxing Section. NLB The third excerpt, entitled
            Stealing The Magic Herb, will give Zhang Shulian a chance to show
            her mettle. It is taken from Madam White Snake, a popular story
            about the love between a snake and a man. In this episode, Zhang
            (who plays Madam White Snake) tries to steal a magic herb to save
            her husband. Four fairies guarding the herb engage her in battle.
